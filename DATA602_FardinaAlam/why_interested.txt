Why are you interested in taking DATA602?

I am very interested in topics related to Natural Language Processing like computational linguistics, transformers, psycholinguistics and transformers from cognitive standpoint. But in order to precisely program an industry-grade NLP project, it is quite essential for me to follow the data science lifecycle.
DATA602 would help me wrangle, explore, visualize and understand data. As we move on to further lectures, there are topics in deep learning too- that can help me improve my standards in writing clean and efficient code. DATA602 is also a project-driven course, essentially getting me to focus on a single large project throughout the semester so that I can dedicate much of my time to address a problem statement.
